# R-script
The R-script is the file: script_candnr8.R \
It uses the CSV-files in the repository, but YOU need to set the correct working directory! 

# CSV-files
Files dowloaded from HortControl (i.e. data from the PlantEye scans): \
Cand8_Raddishes_control_20220309_planteye.csv \
Cand8_Raddishes_drought_20220309_planteye.csv \
Cand8_Raddishes_sideproject_20220309_planteye.csv \
Cand8_Strawberries2_20220309_planteye.csv \
